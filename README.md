This Repository contains a solution for one of the problem statement given in Hackathon "What the Hack", organized by technical council IIT Gandhinagar. Th eproblem statement is as follows:

### Logic-Based Security System

Design and simulate a **Logic-Based Security System** using basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR) in TinkerCAD. Your task is to create a digital circuit that replicates the functionality of a simple security system, where multiple conditions need to be satisfied for the system to allow access.

- Use inputs such as simulated sensor signals (motion sensor, door sensor, keypad entries).
- The system should activate an alarm if any of the sensors detect a breach (for example, motion detected but no valid entry code).
- Simulate different scenarios to ensure the logic gates are working correctly under various conditions.
- Provide a truth table and logic circuit diagram.

In the following repository you will find the PDF for the circuit diagram along with the Tinkarcad link for the simulation of the circuit. A link of google docs for Truth table.
